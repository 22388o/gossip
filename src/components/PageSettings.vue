        <blockquote>
            When the feed loads, it pulls in events going
            back at most this many seconds. (If you want to go back further, there will
            be a <em>load more</em> at the end of the feed, after which another chunk
            of posts of this size will be loaded). If you make this too big, Gossip
            will take a long time to load. Default is 43200 (which is 12 hours).
            NOTE: we have not implemented <em>load more</em> yet.

        <b>Overlap:</b>

        <blockquote>
            Gossip remembers events, and it remembers the time when
            it last got an 'end of subscribed events' message. But instead of asking
            for every event since then, we back up a bit more because (1) not everybody's
            clocks are synchronized, and (2) events take some time to propogate through
            the relays. Default is 600 (which is 10 minutes).
        </blockquote>

        <b>Autofollow:</b>
        <input type="checkbox" :checked="state.settings.autofollow!=0" @click="state.settings.autofollow = 1 - state.settings.autofollow" />

        <blockquote>
            When we receive events that refer to people we don't
            know about yet, do you want to automatically follow those people
            anonymously? The default is not to.
